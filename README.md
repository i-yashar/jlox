# jlox

Interpreter for a dynamically typed object-oriented language. The name jlox is result of the fact that the underlying code is in Java and the language which it interprets is called Lox.
I've been using the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom as my guide.It's an excellent resource aimed at peple who want to learn about interpreters and compilers, which focuses both on the practical and theoretical aspect of the matter.
